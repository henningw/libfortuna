#libfortuna

This library uses code from the PostgreSQL database project.
http://www.postgres.org/

The original source location (in the postgres source tree) is
contrib/pgcrypto. Also, parts of src/include/postgres.h and 
src/include/c.h

The postgres specific parts were reduced and also the not needed
blowfish cypher implementation removed.
